class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def create(cls):
        # You can use this method to create and return an instance.
        return cls()

    def __call__(self):
        # This makes the class instance callable, like an object.
        return "Instance called as an object."

# Usage:
obj = MyClass.create()  # Creating an instance using the class method
print(obj())  # Calls the `__call__` method
