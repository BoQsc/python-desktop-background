Let's make an array of 50 rectangles for taskbar area.
If there is overflow, show the non-overflown rectangles.
Add pagination, and count how many rectangles are non-overflown, each page should have that amount of rectangles.
If the width of the taskbar increases then more rectangles should be shown.

bad idea: Those that do not fit, let's create more arrays 



Make visible-tasks-area
Make the entire tasks array
Append rectangle to the end of visible-tasks-area if possible to insert the size of rectangle.
Increment by visible tasks amount if a button "next" is pressed.
Count how many overflown "next" presses needed to show in as UI label.
