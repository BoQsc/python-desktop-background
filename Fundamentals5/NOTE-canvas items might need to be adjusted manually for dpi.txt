According to tk_scaling_factor.py, it might be that widgets are automatically adjusted for dpi.
Meanwhile the canvas items have to be adjusted manually for DPI.

Canvas items are DPI dependant. Meaning they change size depending on the DPI.
DPI independant canvas items handled to appear the same way accross devices without scaling to DPI.

Or maybe it's opposite. DPI independent automatically scaled over multiple pixels, ignoring the pixels. Treating multiple pixels as single pixel.
DPI aware, dependent, account for the smaller pixels and do not ignore.
