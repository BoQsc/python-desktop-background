640x50 resolution choice:
640 is standard VGA Width, which means it is supported by most monitors.
50 height is regular heights of taskbar, a custom choice.

640 width was also chosen to easily see if taskbar resizing of width to the screen width is working.
It is small enough but standard size to support VGA even if for some reason the taskbar width resizing do not work.
